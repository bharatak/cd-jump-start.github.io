## Project Catalyst

Every project requires to set up it’s services and components to deliver both the business functionality and the non functional requirements around those. Apart from the typical user facing non functional requirements a system will also have aspects that need to be put in place that are needed to serve the needs of developers, DevOps and TechOps. Given that most of the systems are hosted on distributed and dynamic environments such as a container orchestration or service mesh infra even basic things like configuration and logging need to follow certain best practices. Or this could be things like metrics collection and monitoring across service nodes and instances which may be considered in a monolith world, but is a basic need in today’s distributed systems. 

Typically projects evolve and adapt these over a period as the system gets to production and beyond. Instead it will be tremendously useful for every project to start by having a foundation that caters to these needs so that the teams get a working base and can focus on the business functionality. They can evolve this working base and customize it further to the changing needs of the specific project.

Project Catalyst aims at providing this foundation to projects in following ways:
* Documentation
  * Compilation of best practices in the key aspects of developing, deploying and monitoring micro services (and in due course other solutions such as ML or SPA applications)
  * Recommendations on what practice to use and tool / framework references
  * Reference to code samples

* Code
  * An open source starter kit that provides the working foundation
  * Opinionated and customizable per project
  * Can be used in full or parts

* Dev Infra
  * Developer setup for all the related tools/ frameworks that matches the code
  * CI/CD  set up that is ready to go - Opinionated and customizable per project
  * Addresses common aspects such as ... tbd...

* Production Infra
